# Godot Utils
A library of utility functions for the Godot game engine.

## Installation
1. Download and un-zip files.
2. The files can be placed anywhere inside your Godot project, but I suggest placing the entire `godot_utils` folder inside the `addons` folder.

## Usage

Each utility is a class, and is declared automatically inside Godot, so you can reference the classes with their names just like any other built-in class. (ex. `FileUtils.get_files_in_directory("res://addons")` )
