# Godot Utils
A library of utility functions for the Godot game engine.

## Usage

### Utils
Add each necessary file as a singleton to your project, and reference them from that singleton.

### Classes
Each class is declared automatically inside Godot, so you can reference the classes with their names just like any other class.
